# DevBuzz - Buzworthy Tech Gossip

DevBuzz is a full-stack web application consisting of a frontend and a backend server built to complement the frontend.

The project aims to provide users with a platform for publishing posts about tech innovations and news and sharing their views about topics by commenting on them.

This addition directs users to the README.md files in the `client` and `server` directories for more detailed instructions and information about the frontend and backend, respectively.

## Hosting

The project's front-end is deployed on Firebase and accessible through the following URLs:

-   ðŸ”— https://dev-buzz.web.app/
-   ðŸ”— https://dev-buzz.firebaseapp.com/

Meanwhile, the project's back-end is hosted on Render, and the database is managed by MongoDB Atlas.

_Note_: The initial load time of the website is longer until Render boots up the Web-Service and afterwards everything starts running smooth and fast.

## Disclaimer

Cookies are not set from the back-end, they're sent inside the response from the back-end and set from the front-end in order to comply with Google's ongoing migration to privacy preserving solutions and the deprecation of third-party cookies:
