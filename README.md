# DevBuzz - Buzworthy Tech Gossip

DevBuzz is a full-stack web application consisting of a frontend, developed as a course project for completing the SoftUni Angular Course, and a backend server built to complement the frontend.

The project aims to provide users with a platform for publishing posts about tech innovations and news and sharing their views about topics by commenting on them.

This addition directs users to the README.md files in the `client` and `server` directories for more detailed instructions and information about the frontend and backend, respectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

-   **Node.js**: DevBuzz requires Node.js to run both the frontend and backend servers. You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
