# DevBuzz - Buzworthy Tech Gossip

DevBuzz is a full-stack web application consisting of a frontend, developed as a course project for completing the SoftUni Angular Course, and a backend server built to complement the frontend.

The project aims to provide users with a platform for publishing posts about tech innovations and news and sharing their views about topics by commenting on them.

This addition directs users to the README.md files in the `client` and `server` directories for more detailed instructions and information about the frontend and backend, respectively.

## Hosting

The project's front-end is deployed on Firebase and accessible through the following URLs:

-   ðŸ”— https://dev-buzz.web.app/

Meanwhile, the project's back-end is hosted on Render, and the database is managed by MongoDB Atlas.
